        'Did you know that the novel "Lolita" would not exist if Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s wife hadn\u2019t stopped her husband from burning the manuscript? Or that Gandhi learned his legendary method of passive resistance from his wife? Or that the person responsible for Maya Angelou\u2019s genre-defining memoir was her good friend James Baldwin? Significant Others is a narrated, nonfiction podcast about folks just beyond the spotlight of history. Each episode tells the story of a talented, difficult and little-known individual who altered the destiny of their better-known partner, child, sibling, or friend, and impacted the world they left behind. Narrated and written by Liza Powel O\u2019Brien and featuring the voices of Megan Mullally, Nick Offerman, Jameela Jamil, Rita Wilson, Timothy Olyphant, Lisa Kudrow and many more.',

        "A few years ago I was a broke, university dropout, living in one of the worst parts of the country, alone, with nothing but a laptop &amp; a dream. Fast forward a few years, I\u2019m the 29 year old ex CEO of one of the UK\u2019s fastest growing companies. That company is called Social Chain. My world is intense, sometimes crazy, always challenging and always unpredictable. This podcast is simple, every week I\u2019m going to share insights with you from guests with different backgrounds, experiences and learnings. I want to give you a look into what it\u2019s like behind the scenes, being an entrepreneur, the deep, dark thoughts that nobody else will share with you and anything else that\u2019s playing on my mind. This is not scripted and I don't have questions I just see where the conversation takes me. This is the diary of a CEO, I\u2019m Steven Bartlett. I hope nobody is listening, but if you are\u2026 keep this to yourself.\n\nFOLLOW \u25ba\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/steven/)\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/SteveBartlettSC?s=20)\nLinkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenbartlett-123/)",
