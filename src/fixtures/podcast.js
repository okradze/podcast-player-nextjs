      description:
        "A parent writes that she and her husband are concerned their toddler feels responsible for their emotions. This is a trait they both recognize from their own backgrounds.  \u201cHe asks again and again, \u2018Happy, mommy?\u2019 as if he\u2019s trying to help me be happy.\u201d This mom says that if she admits that, no, she is not entirely happy at the moment, he gives her hugs and cuddles and persists in asking if she's happy. While these parents want to foster their child\u2019s empathy and sensitivity, they don\u2019t want him taking on the burden of other people\u2019s emotions. They\u2019re hoping Janet has some advice to help manage this delicate balancing act.\n\nThanks again to Ritual Vitamins for supporting this podcast.

Another email describes how a 3-year-old\u2019s tantrums last all afternoon and into the evening, disrupting the rest of the family\u2019s routine, and they \u201call feel trapped by and 3-year-old.\u201d And a therapist observes that her child holds in emotions in front of family and peers.

The parent admits that both she and her husband were frustrated and \u201ctriggered\u201d by the behavior, and they reacted with anger and scolding. The situation came to a head when their boy started lying about his actions, which was particularly hurtful to his dad. After reading some of Janet\u2019s advice, they were able to consider their child\u2019s POV with empathy and realize how their reactions may have \u201cmade the truth feel unsafe or uncomfortable.\u201d They changed their approach completely and now feel confident their relationship with their child can survive any future storms.\n\nThanks again to Ritual Vitamins for supporting this podcast.

        "A courageous \u201cUnruffled\u201d listener shares how Janet\u2019s respectful parenting approach seemed an impossible goal during a dark period of self-discovery, but it also presented a beacon of hope. As she struggled to come to grips with recovered memories of her childhood abuse, her relationship with her two young children was combative and destructive. She was left feeling like a complete failure, unable to parent in the loving, respectful way she had always imagined. Her journey to the other side of this despair is a story of strength and perseverance. Ultimately, her message to other parents is: \u201cThe happiness is worth it. The joy is worth it. The connection with your kids is worth it. It\u2019s all worth it.\u201d\n\nResources: Alwynn: alwynnhynescoaching@gmail.com\nInner child work & healing: https://www.laviniabrown.com/coaching\nMarissa Peer: https://youtube.com/user/MarisaPeer1\n\nThanks again to NOOM for sponsoring this episode.

      title: 'Parental Burnout and a Reasonable Approach to Screens (with Dr. Meghan Owenz)',
      description:
        'Janet\u2019s guest is Dr. Meghan Owenz, a psychologist, professor, parent, and author. Meghan\u2019s new book \u201cSpoiled Right: Delaying Screens and Giving Children What They Really Need\u201d offers the latest research on the effects of screens on young children along with a plethora of practical alternatives. Both Janet and Meghan acknowledge that during the last many months of homeschooling, severely limited socializing, and close quarters, exhausted parents have understandably relied on screens to get some much needed (and deserved) break-time. The question many weary parents ask is: \u201cWhat do they do instead?\u201d  Meghan and Janet offer some answers. \n\nThanks to Mack Weldon for sponsoring this episode.
